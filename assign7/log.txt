To first set up the BeagleBone, I created a personal hotspot, connected my
 laptop to the BeagleBone, and scanned for an Access Point named 
BeagleBoneXXXXXX (in my case, BeagleBone62844), then connected my BeagleBone
 to the hotspot.

I then sshed into the BeagleBone with:
	$ ssh root@192.168.8.1
From there, I set up the password for the root user with:
	# sudo passwd root
	Result:
		Enter new UNIX password: 
		Retype new UNIX password: 
		passwd: password updated successfully

I then installed xauth and xterm by typing:
	# apt-get update
	# apt-get install xauth
	# apt-get install xterm
	
I set up my hostname with:
	# hostname elizabeth

Then I connected to my partner's hotspot, and sshed into my partner's board
with:
	# ssh root@192.168.43.138
the numbers being my partner's IP address.  I gave my parter the my own IP 
address by using 
	# ifconfig
		(my IP address was inet addr:192.168.43.224)

This worked fine, so I logged out of my partner's board ($ exit), and then 
created a non-root user account.
	# useradd foo
	# passwd foo
		Enter new UNIX password: 
		Retype new UNIX password: 
		passwd: password updated successfully

I also created a home directory for this account.
	# mkdir /home/foo
	# chown foo /home/foo (to change owner of the directory)

I sshed into my partner's board with:
	# ssh tanusi@192.168.43.138
while she sshed into mine with:
	# ssh foo@192.168.43.224 	

I exited back into my board, and then generated a keypair with
	# ssh-keygen
	Result:
		Generating public/private rsa key pair.
		Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
		Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
		Enter same passphrase again: 
		Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
		Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
		The key fingerprint is:
		65:fc:84:d3:68:86:97:ff:ed:f3:22:7d:ec:e9:b6:d5 
			root@704579512.lasr.cs.ucla.edu
		The key's randomart image is:
		+---[RSA 2048]----+
		|                 |
		|         o =     |

		|            . o+=|
		|             .oBB|
		+-----------------+

I then sshed into my guest account on my partner's BeagleBone: 
	$ ssh tanusi@192.168.43.138
	$ eval `ssh-agent` (to create ssh-agent)       
		Agent pid 6301
	$ exit

Back on my account:
	# ssh-copy-id tanusi@192.168.43.138 (copied my public key into remote
		server
		/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new 
		key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
		/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- 
		if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
		Debian GNU/Linux 8

	
	Number of key(s) added: 1

	Now try logging into the machine, with:  
	 "ssh 'tanusi@192.168.43.138'"
	and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
 
 	# eval `ssh-agent` 
		Agent pid 3348
	# ssh-add
		Identity added: /root/.ssh/id_rsa (rsa w/o comment)
		root@704579512:~# ssh tanusi@192.168.43.138

When I tried logging into the guest account (w/ # ssh tanusi@192.168.43.138), 
I was let in without a password.

I then exited out of my terminals and opened a new one, trying:
	$ ssh -X root@192.168.8.1
And then:
	# ssh -X tanusi@192.168.43.138
When I typed 
	$ xterm
a graphical interface popped up.
