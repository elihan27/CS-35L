01. tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < words 
	tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < words |diff -u words - > words01.diff 
	replace every non-alphabetical character w/ a new line character

02. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < words
	 -s, --squeeze-repeats
         replace each sequence of a repeated character that is listed in the last specified SET, with a single occurrence of that character
	 simply removes every non-alphabetical character.  More specifically, it places a newline character for each non-alphebetical character, then removes the newlines if there 		are repeated occurences

03. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < words | sort > words03
	removes each non-alphabetical character and sorts what's left	
04. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < words | sort -u > words04
	appears to remove non-alphabetical characters, sorts it, then removes repeated occurrences of a word
05. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < words | sort -u | comm - words > words05
	appears to remove non-alphabetical characters, sorts it, then removes repeated occurrences of a word, and then compares this line by line with the original file
06. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < words | sort -u | comm -23 - words > words06
	appears to remove non-alphabetical characters, sorts it, then removes repeated occurrences of a word, and then compares this line by line with the original file
	

 With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines com‚Äê
       mon to both files.

       -1     suppress column 1 (lines unique to FILE1)

       -2     suppress column 2 (lines unique to FILE2)

       -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)

But then removes the second and third column, so you only have the words that show up after the file's been sorted.
