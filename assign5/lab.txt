After writing tr2u.c and tr2b.c, compile:
	$ gcc -g -o tr2u tr2u.c
	$ gcc -g -o tr2b tr2b.c

Write a program that prints out 5000000 characters, compile and run to make a 
file that is 5000000 bytes.
	$ gcc -g -o million 5000000.c
	$ ./million > 5million.txt

Compare performance when tr is printed to a file
	$ strace cat 5million.txt | ./tr2u a z > zu.txt
	$ strace cat 5million.txt | ./tr2b a z > zb.txt

Compare performance when tr is printed to terminal
	$ strace cat 5million.txt | ./tr2u a z
	$ strace cat 5million.txt | ./tr2b a z

tr2u and tr2b had the same commands as each other when printed to terminal or 
copied in the same file.  Both tr2u and tr2b when printed to terminal are
quicker than tr2u and tr2b when copying to a file, and tr2b is always faster
than tr2u.

tr2u:
	$ time cat 5million.txt | ./tr2u a z
	real	0m8.580s
	user	0m1.346s
	sys	0m7.251s

tr2b: 
	$ time cat 5million.txt | ./tr2b a z
	real	0m0.707s
	user	0m0.138s
	sys	0m0.057s
