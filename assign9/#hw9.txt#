To checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch named œôòüquoteœôòý:
	$ git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils //clone another version of eggert's 
		repository 
	$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote


To install my change into the new branch:
	$ cp  ~/35L/assign9/lab/test02/diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt
	$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

		patching file src/cmp.c
		patching file src/diff.c
		patching file src/diff3.c
		patching file src/dir.c
		patching file src/sdiff.c
		patching file src/util.c

To create a changelog entry:
	Became familiar with add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a).  After taking a 
look at the provided example, I opened src/cmp.c and used (C-x 4 a) to write my ChangeLog 
(see below), which was saved in the src directory.  I moved it back into the parent 
directory with:
	$ mv src/ChangeLog .
 
	2018-03-15  Elizabeth Erika Han  <elihan@g.ucla.edu>

        * cmp.c: Replaced grave accents with apostrophe marks in
        character string constants outside of comments.
        * src/diff.c: Likewise.
        * src/diff3.c: Likewise.
        * src/dir.c: Likewise.
        * src/sdiff.c: Likewise.
        * src/util.c: Likewise.

To commit changes to the new branch:
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -F ChangeLog
	I found that the email wasn't quite correct, because I wasn't paying enough 
		attention, so I edited it with:
		$ git config --global --edit
		$ git commit --amend --reset-author //for editing the commit author
	$ git format-patch master // to create the patch
	$ mv 0001-2018-03-15-Elizabeth-Erika-Han-elihan-g.ucla.edu.patch formatted-
		patch.txt //obtain patch
	
My partner was Royson Lin.  
We sent each other patches our patches like so:
	$ scp elizabeh@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu:~/35L/assign9/hw/test00/diffutils/formatted-
		patch.txt classroy@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu:~

To checkout version 3.0 into a new temporary branch:
	$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner

Apply patch with: 
	$ git am formatted-patch.txt

Procedure then follows similarly to the one in the lab:
	Modify Makefile.am file, change file permissions, run ./bootstrap, apply the 
		provided patch from the website, configure, make and make check.
	$ emacs tests/Makefile.am 
	$ chmod +x tests/binary tests/no-newline-at-eof
	$ ./bootstrap
	$ wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter18/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
	$ patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
	$ ./configure
	$ make 
	$ make check

I and my parner verified that our ChangeLog entry works, by running the command œôòümake 
distdirœôòý and inspecting the resulting diffutils*/ChangeLog file.
	In my case, this file was directdiffutils-3.0.1-f29d-dirty/ChangeLog, and it had 
my partner's ChangeLog entry at the top of the file:

2018-03-15 Royson Lin <classroy@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>
                * src/cmp.c: Replaced ' with ` in non-character string constant\
s.
                * diff.c: Replaced ' with ` in non-character string constants.
                * diff3.c: Replaced ' with ` in non-character string constants.
                * dir.c: Replaced ' with ` in non-character string constants.
                * sdiff.c: Replaced ' with ` in non-character string constants.
                * util.c: Replaced ' with ` in non-character string constants.
	
Royson also had my entry at the top of his own ChangeLog file, so in both cases, the patch 
was successful.

gitk:
	First: download XQuartz
	Then: $ ssh -X elizabeh@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu // the important thing is -X
	Then: $ gitk ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs 
	
	The graphical interface popped up at this point.
