The interface can be roughly divided into two main windows: 
	I) Top: Metadata, split into three subwindows.
		1) Left: appears to a commit tree - a visualization of the project history, showing all the branches.
		2) Center: lists the author/creator of each change/branch/merge
		3) Right: shows the modification date of each change/branch/merge
	II) Bottom: actual content
		1) Left: the contents of the change itself
			a) Top: similar to I, containing info such as the auther, what 
				tree is its parent/child, its branches, its order, etc.
			b) Bottom: the files.  Options for viewing the old version/new 
				version of the file, as will as a diff file.
		2) Right: labeled as "Comments", but appears to be other files/trees 
			involved with the change
